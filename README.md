# Artificial Intelligence Homeworks

This repository contains homework assignments for the Artificial Intelligence course taught by [Dr. Mirzaei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4t4LRdoAAAAJ&hl=en)
 at Isfahan University of Technology. The homework assignments are focused on two problems, the N-Queen problem and the Maximum N-bit function. These problems were solved using the genetic algorithm approach..

## Problem Statements
### N-Queen Problem
The N-Queen problem involves placing N chess queens on an NxN chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. In other words, no two queens are allowed to be placed on the same row, column, or diagonal. The goal of the problem is to find a solution that satisfies these constraints.

### Maximum N-bit Function
The Maximum N-bit function involves finding an N-bit number that is the maximum for a given function. The function used in this homework assignment is not specified.

## Approach
The genetic algorithm approach was used to solve both problems. Genetic algorithms are a type of optimization algorithm inspired by the process of natural selection. The algorithm involves generating a population of potential solutions, evaluating their fitness based on the problem constraints, and using crossover and mutation operations to generate new potential solutions.
